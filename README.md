# Downloads Organizer

A Python program that **organizes** your **downloads folder** based on **file extensions.**

## How to Run

Double-click the **app.bat** file, or run the **runner.py** inside a terminal.

## How it Works

When you run the application, it will operate silently in the background and perform a cleanup task every 5 seconds. Additionally, it will be registered in the Windows registry, ensuring that the script starts automatically each time your computer boots up.
